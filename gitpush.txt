 Use Git and Push to GitHub
Render deploys directly from a Git repository. If your project isn't already in Git, you'll need to upload it to a service like GitHub.

Initialize Git: git init

Add all files: git add .

Commit your changes: git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"

Create a repository on GitHub and push your code to it.


git remote add origin https://github.com/Singhrahul2511/Full-Stack-Mind-Map-Generator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
